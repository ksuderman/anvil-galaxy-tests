            Starting Unicycler (2022-03-26 22:56:41)    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since youprovided only short reads, Unicycler will essentially function as a SPAdes-optimiser. It will try many k-mer sizes, choose the best based on contig lengthand graph connectivity, and scaffold the graph using SPAdes repeat resolution.

It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance offinding an ideal assembly.SPAdes maximum k-mer: 127Median read length: 251K-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127SPAdes assemblies (2022-03-26 22:56:43)    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores theassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) andthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),where c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.== Warning ==  No assembly mode was specified!

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring onlyonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearlysingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one linkper side.Median depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00Initial single copy segments:    1    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through thegraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resultingcontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,additional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. Thisallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at themedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).

SPAdes saves the graph pathscorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of thesepaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge fromthe path.No SPAdes contig bridgesCreating loop unrolling bridges (2022-03-26 22:57:39)    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contigof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.the loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of themiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop andmakes a bridge.No loop unrolling bridges madenone foundApplying bridges (2022-03-26 22:57:39)    Unicycler now applies to the graph in decreasing order of quality.

            Starting Unicycler (2022-03-26 22:59:24)    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since youprovided both short and long reads, Unicycler will perform a hybrid assembly.It will first use SPAdes to make a short-read assembly graph, and then it willuse various methods to scaffold that graph with the long reads.

It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance offinding an ideal assembly.SPAdes maximum k-mer: 127Median read length: 251K-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127SPAdes assemblies (2022-03-26 22:59:26)    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores theassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) andthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),where c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.== Warning ==  No assembly mode was specified!

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring onlyonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearlysingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one linkper side.Median depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00Initial single copy segments:    1    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through thegraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resultingcontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,additional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. Thisallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at themedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).

SPAdes saves the graph pathscorresponding to these contigs in the contigs.paths file. When one of thesepaths contains two or more anchor contigs, Unicycler can create a bridge fromthe path.No SPAdes contig bridgesCreating loop unrolling bridges (2022-03-26 23:00:23)    When a SPAdes contig path connects an anchor contig with the middle contigof a simple loop, Unicycler concludes that the sequences are contiguous (i.e.the loop is not a separate piece of DNA). It then uses the read depth of themiddle and repeat contigs to guess the number of times to traverse the loop andmakes a bridge.No loop unrolling bridges madenone foundLoading reads (2022-03-26 23:00:23)0 / 1 (0.0%)1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bp1 / 1 (100.0%) - 5,386 bpAssembling contigs and long reads with miniasm (2022-03-26 23:00:23)    Unicycler uses miniasm to construct a string graph assembly using both theshort read contigs and the long reads. It will then use the resulting stringgraph to produce bridges between contigs. This method requires decent coverageof long reads and therefore may not be fruitful if long reads are sparse.However, it does not rely on the short read assembly graph having goodconnectivity and is able to bridge an assembly graph even when it contains manydead ends.    Unicycler uses two types of "reads" as assembly input: anchor contigs fromthe short-read assembly and actual long reads which overlap two or more ofthese contigs. It then assembles them with miniasm.Aligning long reads to graph using minimapSaving /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/223/working/miniasm_assembly/all_segments.fasta1538635081-153864508250785078255cm:i:11341538650905383-1538650885381293293255cm:i:63Number of minimap alignments: 1Saving to /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/223/working/miniasm_assembly/01_assembly_reads.fastq:  0 short-read contigs  1 long readsFinding overlaps with minimap... failedAssembling reads with miniasm... empty resultCreating simple long read bridges (2022-03-26 23:00:23)    Unicycler uses long read alignments (from minimap) to resolve simple repeatstructures in the graph.

This usually representsa simple 2-copy repeat, and there are two possible options for its resolution:(A->C->D and B->C->E) or (A->C->E and B->C->D). Each read which spans such ajunction gets to "vote" for option 1, option 2 or neither. Unicycler creates abridge at each junction for the most voted for option.No suitable two-way junctions present    Simple loops are parts of the graph where two contigs (A and B) areconnected via a repeat (C) which loops back to itself (via D). It is possibleto traverse the loop zero times (A->C->B), one time (A->C->D->C->B), two times(A->C->D->C->D->C->B), etc. Long reads which span the loop inform which is thecorrect number of times through. In this step, such reads are found and each isaligned against alternative loop counts. A reads casts its "vote" for the loopcount it agrees best with, and Unicycler creates a bridge using the most votedfor count.No suitable simple loops presentDetermining low score threshold (2022-03-26 23:00:23)    Before conducting semi-global alignment of the long reads to the assemblygraph, Unicycler must determine a minimum alignment score threshold such thatnonsense alignments are excluded. To choose a threshold automatically, itexamines alignments between random sequences and selects a score a few standarddeviations above the mean.Automatically choosing a threshold using random alignment scores.Random alignment mean score: 61.66         standard deviation:  1.31        Low score threshold: 61.66 + (7 x 1.31) = 70.86Aligning reads with minimap (2022-03-26 23:00:23)1538655077-153868508050725072255cm:i:9451538650935384-1538650875378291291255cm:i:52Done! 1 out of 1 reads alignedAligning reads (2022-03-26 23:00:23)1/1: 1 (5386 bp)minimap alignments:    5,5077,-,1,8,5080    5093,5384,-,1,5087,5378Reference ranges:    1-: 0 - 5386Range: 1: 0 - 5386    common 10-mers: 5464    line 1: 5076 points, score=5074.000394 (good)    line 2: 292 points, score=290.006826 (good)All Seqan alignments (time to align = 0.068 s):  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity         1          0     5085           0      5085       -      15255        100.00   100.00%         1       5085     5386        5085      5386       -        903        100.00   100.00%Final alignments:  Ref name  Ref start  Ref end  Read start  Read end  Strand  Raw score  Scaled score  Identity         1          0     5085           0      5085       -      15255        100.00   100.00%         1       5085     5386        5085      5386       -        903        100.00   100.00%Read alignment summary (2022-03-26 23:00:23)Total read count:            1Fully aligned reads:         1Partially aligned reads:     0Unaligned reads:             0Total bases aligned:     5,386 bpMean alignment identity:   100.0%Deleting /galaxy/server/database/jobs_directory/000/223/working/read_alignment/Setting the minimum scaled score to the 5.0th percentile of full read alignments: 0.00Building long read bridges (2022-03-26 23:00:23)    Unicycler uses the long read alignments to produce bridges between anchorsegments.

            Starting Unicycler (2022-03-26 22:58:05)    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since youprovided only short reads, Unicycler will essentially function as a SPAdes-optimiser. It will try many k-mer sizes, choose the best based on contig lengthand graph connectivity, and scaffold the graph using SPAdes repeat resolution.

It uses a wide range of many k-mer sizes to maximise the chance offinding an ideal assembly.SPAdes maximum k-mer: 127Median read length: 251K-mer range: 27, 47, 63, 77, 89, 99, 107, 115, 121, 127SPAdes assemblies (2022-03-26 22:58:06)    Unicycler now uses SPAdes to assemble the short reads. It scores theassembly graph for each k-mer using the number of contigs (fewer is better) andthe number of dead ends (fewer is better). The score function is 1/(c*(d+2)),where c is the contig count and d is the dead end count.== Warning ==  No assembly mode was specified!

Single-copy contigs (those with a multiplicity of one, occurring onlyonce in the underlying sequence) are particularly useful.    Multiplicity determination begins by identifying contigs which are clearlysingle-copy because they are of low depth and do not have more than one linkper side.Median depth of 10 longest contigs: 1.00Initial single copy segments:    1    Unicycler now uses a greedy algorithm to propagate multiplicity through thegraph. For example, if two single-copy contigs merge together, the resultingcontig will get a multiplicity of two. When no more propagation is possible,additional single-copy contigs are added and the process is repeated. Thisallows for multiplicity to be correctly assigned to the chromosome (at themedian depth) but also for plasmids (which may be higher or lower in depth).
